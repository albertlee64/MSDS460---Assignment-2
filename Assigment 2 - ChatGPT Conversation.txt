Define Decision Variables: Start times for each task.2. Objective Function: Minimize the total project duration.3. Constraints:o Precedence constraints: A task cannot start before its predecessor finishes.o Non-negative start times.I'll proceed with implementing this linear program in Python using PuLP. ??It looks like there was an issue installing PuLP due to a temporary network failure. Since I can't directly install packages in this environment, you may need to install PuLP manually in your local Python environment using:bashCopyEditpip install pulpOnce installed, you can run the provided Python script in your environment to generate the project schedule.

The critical path is found by:1. Finding the earliest start and finish times for each task.2. Finding the latest start and finish times without delaying the project.3. Determining the tasks with zero slack time, which means they are on the critical path.I'll extend the previous linear programming model to calculate the critical path based on the expected durations.I have recalculated the critical path for the project based on the expected durations while ensuring all task dependencies are met. You can now see the critical path analysis in the displayed table.The critical path represents the longest sequence of dependent tasks that determine the minimum project completion time.
